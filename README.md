# CuttingStockAlgorithmComparisonRH
This project aims to compare existing attempts to minimize waste created from cutting standard length wood studs into desired cuts and quantities 

There are two different sets of inputs to be evaluated: a set of 2x4 cuts and a set of 2x6 cuts

For this project, dictionaries are used to store the inputs as [key,value] = [cut, quantity] 

Hence, there are two input dictionaries, one for the set of 2x4 cuts and one for the set of 2x6 cuts.

The input dictionaries will be pulled from an excel file stored in the repo, 

and output will be exported excel output file with an excel sheet for each set of inputs (2 total sheets, 2x4 and 2x6 results sheets) comparing each algorithm with the following parameters:
